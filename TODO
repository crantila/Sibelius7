DONE: Adjust the orchestration
  DONE: add additional instruments (with only one movement, but naming undefined)
    DONE: add 1 trumpet
    DONE: add horn 4
    DONE: add 3 trombones
    NB: I decided to keep the string parts all together, so I'll have to add extra staves as needed
  DONE: update LilyPond version (to 2.12.3)
  DONE: change number of movements to one
  DONE: re-adjust the new parts, so that their notes are called "\notesMvtI"


-Remove Beethoven information and input Sibelius metadata
  DONE: change instrument names to German
  DONE: change all occurrences of "MvtI" to "Symph"
  DONE: inspect "defs.ily" to see what could be useful, and what would screw me up
    DONE: change the "outline" to include rehearsal marks and tempo markings as appropriate
    DONE: figure out how to make the rehearsal marks use the letter "I"
    DONE: find out how to make an O-umlaut rehearsal mark
    DONE: find the 6/4 marking before score page 29; input to "defs.ily"
  DONE: revise "header.ly"
  DONE: change "score.ly" part  and ensure it compiles correctly
  DONE: remove old notes from parts
  DONE: error-check that all parts are correct as follows:
    DONE: rehearsal marks (including "I" and "O-umlaut"
    DONE: tempo changes
    DONE: metre changes
    DONE: check proper instrument-family grouping in the full score
-Input score
  -develop a solution where the tempo changes don't use \mark command, so they don't conflict with rehearsal marks; nice to use a function
  -change the "cut time" marks to read "2/2"
  -remove the text spanners in word-based dynamic marks
